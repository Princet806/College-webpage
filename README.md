# Meerut Institute of Technology Website

This is a web development project for creating the official website of *Meerut Institute of Technology*. The website consists of several pages that provide information about the institute, its courses, faculty, admissions, and more. The project is still in progress, and more features and pages will be added over time.

## Project Overview

The website currently has the following pages:

### 1. **Homepage**
   - The homepage provides an overview of the institute, including important announcements, upcoming events, and quick links to other sections of the website.
   - **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS
   - **File**: `collegeindex.htm`, `collegestyle.css`
   
### 2. **Login Page**
   - The login page allows students and faculty to securely log into the system for access to their personalized dashboard.
   - **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS
   - **File**: `login.htm`, `login.css`

## Future Features

I am actively working on adding more features and functionalities to the website, including:

- **Registration Page**: For new users to sign up and create an account.
- **Course Pages**: A section displaying detailed information about available courses and departments.
- **Faculty Page**: Information about faculty members, their qualifications, and their contact details.
- **Contact Us Page**: A page for users to get in touch with the institute.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring that the website is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile devices and tablets.
- **Backend Integration**: In the future, I plan to integrate backend services for user authentication, session management, and data handling using technologies like PHP/Node.js and a database such as MySQL.
